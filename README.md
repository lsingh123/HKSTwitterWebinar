# HKSTwitterWebinar

Code from my Webinar on Using the Twitter API for HKS's Summer Python Course. A recording of the webinar will be available via the course's Canvas site. I have not included my API credentials in this repo (for obvious reasons). For more information about the course, visit https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/digitalhks/intro-programming-pilot
